## Who Am I?:

As you have undoubtedly seen if you have look at my About page, I'm Dave. I have been working in the tech industry for the last 16 years though I have been into computers since the mid 1990s.

### Technology background

I first created webpages on the old Geocities site back in the 1990s. A few of them were pretty cool and I made do with what I had coding with static HTML. CSS wasn't even a thing yet back then. Like many in the late 90's I had a MySpace page and had customized it as much as I could. In the early 2000's I helped to manage my car club's forums which was built on vBulletin. I briefly tried my hand at PHP but did not follow through with it. I have built multiple static webpages from the 90s to the 00s on various platforms that are were out there including my own domain on a VPS around the 2003-2005 area. It suited what I needed.

### Network Engineering

I got lucky to have gotten a chance to work at a company based out of St. Louis, MO as a front line Network Technical Service Representative. This was my entry to learning about Networking. I stuck with that company for 15 years and through several promotions I had the title of Technical Service Engineer and supported client specific environments in the realm of Networking, Security, and Load Balancing technologies.

### Learning to code - Python

I got very interested in Python about 4 years ago at the urging of my manager at the time. He helped me when I had questions and I helped to build a custom internal API that would lead to a new Network Automation team being created. Unfortunately, they did not have enough head count to pull me over so I could continue my Python coding in practice at work.

### Learning to code - JavaScript/ReactJS

That same previous manager also got me interested in learning about ReactJS. I found a course on Udemy for React and took the dive 3 years ago into learning how things worked. I should have taken a vanilla JavaScript course first but I did not quite understand at the time how intertwined it all was. I did eventually go back and take a vanilla JS course and have not looked back. I love coding in React. It brings me a sort of calm I never had and it's just awesome to see something I have ceated come to life on the screen in front of me.

### Where I'm at now...

I am unfortunately no longer with my original tech company but did make a move to doing Network & Security Engineering at a new company. I'm still coding in Python and JavaScript with a focus mostly on React but I am also taking a journey to other frameworks. I have done a little bit with Vue and see the benefits of Quasar. This site is built with React/NextJS and I couldn't be happier with the outcome so far.

### What Is this site for?

I built this site to put my work out there. I would love to move over into a Front End or even Full Stack Developer Role. While I love what I do in Networking, it doesn't bring me the joy and calm that coding does. I plan to write some technical blog posts on the technologies that interest me and maybe even some that don't. It's all up in the air right now.

### Other interesting information about me:

I am an automotive enthusiast. I like everything from old school Hot Rods to Imports to Supercars. I currently own a GMC Sierra Denali, an 04 Acura RSX, and a 49 Chevy truck. I love working on cars in all facets. I am a railfan (person who loves trains) and model railroader. I am an amateur photographer and enjoy any time I can break out my camera. I like almost all things SCI-FI including both StarTrek and Star Wars. My favorite shows are NCIS (all of them), FireFly, The Good Doctor, and Eureka. My favorite movies are Serenity (the one that is in the FireFly universe), American Graffiti, Gone in 60 Seconds (both the original and the remake), and Dazed and Confused.
